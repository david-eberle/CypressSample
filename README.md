# TestHub Cypress Tests

## Description

This repository contains a basic Cypress setup designed to create and run automated end-to-end tests for the [TestHub](https://github.com/david-eberle/TestHub) project. The project serves as a lightweight, professional testing scaffold to validate key workflows and functionality of TestHub in a controlled environment.

It is intended as a starting point for QA engineers or developers who want to add automated test coverage, with an easy-to-understand structure and example tests.

## Features
